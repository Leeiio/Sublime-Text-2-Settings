# My Sublime Text 2 Settings

What the shit? Hmmmm, This repository contains the contents of my Sublime Text 2 settings for myself.I use an OS X Lion for my work, so the settings folder is in **~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2**.

## WARNING!

I keep modifying these more or less daily so things might get broken.
Don't blame me if that happends.

It's probably better to make copy of these to another location and just copy the parts you find most useful.
